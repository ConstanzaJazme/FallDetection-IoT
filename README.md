# FallDetection-IoT

FallDetection-IoT was born from the idea of ​​using the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve the quality of life in elderly people. After consulting a lots of research, I find an interesting and important topic: Fall Detection.

During aging, a series of modifications occurs in those mechanisms that regulate the balance and locomotive ability, such as decreased ankle strength, loss of elasticity, decreased joint mobility, among others. Therefore, as the years progress, the locomotive capacity can be severely affected by poorly attended falls, increasing morbidity, functional deterioration and mortality rate.[1]

This project is developed with the purpose of being presented as a thesis to apply for the degree of computer science at Universidad Tecnológica Metropolitana
